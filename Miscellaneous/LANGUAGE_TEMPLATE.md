### ðŸ“– **An Overview**

I've created this template to help me organize my journey through the wilds of code.
I'd like to make it as comprehensive as possible, so I can look back on it in the future
and use it as a reference for my own learning, as well as a guide for others who might
stumble upon this.

The following template's aim is to give a bird's eye view of the language's ecosystem,
as well as a high-level overview of its syntax and features. It's not meant to be a
comprehensive guide, but rather a starting point for further exploration.
