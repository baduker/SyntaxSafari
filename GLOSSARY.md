## **A Glossary of various programming terms and quirks.**

### **Table of Contents**

[A](#a), [B](#b), [C](#c), [D](#d), [E](#e), [F](#f), [G](#g), [H](#h), [I](#i),
[J](#j), [K](#k), [L](#l), [M](#m), [N](#n), [O](#o), [P](#p), [Q](#q), [R](#r),
[S](#s), [T](#t), [U](#u), [V](#v), [W](#w), [X](#x), [Y](#y), [Z](#z)

### **A**

#### AWK
- Is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and typically used
as a data extraction and reporting tool. 

### **B**
*B - Placeholder for terms starting with 'B'*

### **C**

#### **CGI**
- CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface. It is a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs that execute like console applications (also known as command-line interface (CLI) programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically. This allows the server to include dynamic content on the web page, such as user interactions, form inputs, or real-time data.


### **D**

#### Dynamic-language
- A programming language that is dynamically typed. This means that the type of
variable is checked during run-time, as opposed to compile-time.

#### Domain-specific-language (DSL)

- A programming language that is specialized to a particular application domain.
For example, SQL is a DSL for querying relational databases. On the other hand,
Perl is a [general-purpose-language](#general-purpose-language-gpl).

### **E**
*E - Placeholder for terms starting with 'E'*

### **F**
*F - Placeholder for terms starting with 'F'*

### **G**

#### General-purpose-language (GPL)
- A programming language that is designed to be used for writing software in a 
wide variety of application domains. A general-purpose language is not 
specialized to a particular area of application. Conversely, a 
[domain-specific](#domain-specific-language-dsl)
programming language (DSL) is used within a specific area. For example, Python 
is a GPL, while SQL is a DSL for querying relational databases.

### **H**

#### High-level-language (HLL)
- A programming language that is a programming language 
with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. A high-level language 
is closer to human language than machine language. High-level languages are 
easier 
to read and write than low-level languages, but they are also less efficient.

### **I**

#### Interpreted-language
- In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly 
executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without 
requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

### **J**
*J - Placeholder for terms starting with 'J'*

### **K**
*K - Placeholder for terms starting with 'K'*

### **L**
*L - Placeholder for terms starting with 'L'*

### **M**
*M - Placeholder for terms starting with 'M'*

### **N**
*N - Placeholder for terms starting with 'N'*

### **O**
*O - Placeholder for terms starting with 'O'*

### **P**
*P - Placeholder for terms starting with 'P'*

### **Q**
*Q - Placeholder for terms starting with 'Q'*

### **R**
*R - Placeholder for terms starting with 'R'*

### **S**

#### Sigil
- A sigil is a symbol attached to a variable name that indicates the variable's
data type. For example, in Perl, the `$` sigil indicates a scalar variable, the
`@` sigil indicates an array variable, and the `%` sigil indicates a hash.

### **T**
*T - Placeholder for terms starting with 'T'*

### **U**
*U - Placeholder for terms starting with 'U'*

### **V**
*V - Placeholder for terms starting with 'V'*

### **W**
*W - Placeholder for terms starting with 'W'*

### **X**
*X - Placeholder for terms starting with 'X'*

### **Y**
*Y - Placeholder for terms starting with 'Y'*

### **Z**
*Z - Placeholder for terms starting with 'Z'*
