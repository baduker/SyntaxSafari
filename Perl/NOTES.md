## **Perl - A Gentle Introduction**

### **What is Perl?**

Here's what I've found about Perl so far:

- Perl was created by Larry Wall in the mid-1980s because
_"`awk` ran out of steam"_
- Perl is a [high-level](../GLOSSARY.md/#high-level-language-hll),
[general-purpose](../GLOSSARY.md/#general-purpose-language-gpl),
[interpreted](../GLOSSARY.md/#interpreted-language),
[dynamic](../GLOSSARY.md/#dynamic-language) programming language.
- The language was inspired by `awk`, `sed`, `C`, `Bourne shell`, and `Lisp`.
- Perl's prime time was in the 1990s, when it was used for
[CGI](../GLOSSARY.md/#CGI) scripting. 
- Also, Perl is famous for its regular expression support. Apparently,
the support is so good that Perl has its own flavor of regular expressions,
which is also used by other languages like, most notably, `Python`, `Java`,
and `PHP`, just to name a few.
- These days, Perl is used for a wide variety of tasks, including system 
administration,
bioinformatics, GUI development, and network programming.

### **So, what's with the name?**

Perl's name is a bit of a mystery. Some say that it stands for "Practical 
Extraction and Report Language". Others say that it's an acronym for
"Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister". Interestingly, Perl was initially
named PEARL, but the name was changed because there was already a language
with that name. One thing's for sure, though: whatever you want to call Perl,
it looks like both the creator and the community have embraced the ambiguity with
a healthy dose of humor.
