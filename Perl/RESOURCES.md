## **An Opinionated List of Perl Resources**

- https://www.perl.org/ - The official Perl website.
- https://learn.perl.org/ - This, at a first glance, looks like a great
place to start learning Perl. It has a bunch of links to tutorials, books, and
other resources. I, particularly, like the
[free online book section](https://www.perl.org/books/library.html).
- [Perldoc](https://perldoc.perl.org/perl#Overview) - The official Perl docs. A
trove of information. I have a feeling I'll be using this a lot!
- [Learn X in Y minutes Where X=Perl](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/perl/) -
A quick overview of Perl syntax and features. I've never used this site before,
but I really like it. It's a great way to get a quick overview of a language.
I'll use it as a reference as I go.
- [Perl on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/perl5) - I've used Exercism for
other languages, mostly Python and Go, and I really like it. It's a great way to
get the feel for a language through a series of small, self-contained exercises.

### Quirks and Oddities

- Turns out there used to be a German (!)
[Perl magazine](https://www.perl-magazin.de/) called `$foo`. It was discontinued
in 2014 though. I've never heard of a programming language having its own
periodical. I wonder if there are any others out there.
- The source code for Perl is available [here](https://www.cpan.org/src/README.html).
There's nothing hilarious about the code itself, but what I found interesting is
the footnote at the bottom of the page:
_Yours Eclectically, The Self-Appointed Master Librarians (OOK!) of the CPAN._
These Perl people sure have a sense of humor!
