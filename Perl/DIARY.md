### **Day 1: October 1st, 2023**

So, I've rolled the (pseudo-random) dice, and it looks like we've got Perl for
my first stop on the safari.

I've never really used Perl beyond a few one-liners here and there, so I'm
excited to see what it's all about.

Also, I've heard that Perl is a bit of a "write-only" language, so I'm curious
to see if that's true.
And some even say that Perl's dead. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I guess
we'll find out soon enough.

In the first couple of days, I'm going to focus on getting a feel for the language
and its ecosystem. I'll be reading the official docs, checking out some tutorials,
researching some best practices, and maybe even reading a book or two.


### **Day 2: October 2nd, 2023**

Today, I mostly did some reading and research. I started with the Wikipedia page,
bookmarked a couple of resources for later, and picked up a copy of the famous
["Lama Book"](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Perl-Making-Things-Possible/dp/1491954329)

I also added the first couple of entries in the [GLOSSARY](../GLOSSARY.md).
Turned out, I had to move it to the root directory, because it's going to be
shared by all the languages, and it takes some amount of dexterity to keep
typing _Miscellaneous_ correctly.

What I didn't do today was actually compile a selection of resources.

### **Day 3: October 3rd, 2023**

Compiled a list of resources. See [RESOURCES](./RESOURCES.md).

Now, I need to go through the list and pick a couple of resources to start with.

### **Day 4: October 4th, 2023**

I've decided to start with the official Perl docs. So far, I've been reading
mostly what's in the [Perldoc](https://perldoc.perl.org/perl#Overview) section.

Turns out, writing about a programming langauge can be engaging and fun - that's
how I can summarize my experience with the official Perl docs so far. 

So far, I've covered:

- [`perlintro`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlintro) Perl introduction for beginners
- [`perldsc`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perldsc) Perl data structures intro
- [`perllol`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perllol) Perl data structures: arrays of arrays
- [`perlreftut`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlreftut) Perl references short introduction
- [`perlstyle`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlstyle) Perl style guide

I'd like to use these docs as the base for a code-like introduction to Perl.

### **Day 5: October 5th, 2023**

Sadly, I didn't get to do much today. I did, however, manage to read a couple of
pages from the "Lama Book" and the [perldoc](https://perldoc.perl.org/perl#Overview)

I'll try to catch up tomorrow.

### **Day 6: October 6th, 2023**

I was mostly going (still!) through the [perldoc](https://perldoc.perl.org/perl#Overview)
and the "Lama Book".

### **Day 7: October 7th, 2023**

No work done. :(

### **Day 8: October 8th, 2023**

Got a draft of my 101-style introduction to Perl based on what I've leared from
the [perldoc](https://perldoc.perl.org/perl#Overview) and the "Lama Book".

### **Day 9: October 9th, 2023**

Wrote the first part of the 101-style introduction to Perl. See [Perl/101](./101/README.md).
I covered the following topics:
- Perl short intro
- Pragmas
- Comments
- Variables
- Scalars
- Arrays
- Hashes
- References

More to come tomorrow!

### **Day 10: October 10th, 2023**

Wrote the second part of the 101-style introduction to Perl. See [Perl/101](./101/README.md).
I added:
- Variable scope
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Operators

Tomorrow, I'd like to cover subroutines and touch on regular expressions and maybe
some `I/O`.

### **Day 11: October 11th, 2023**

I guess I can say I'm done with the 101 thingy. Manged to round it up with
subroutines, regular expressions, and `I/O`. See [Perl/101](./101/README.md).

It's time to get my hands dirty with some actual code. I don't know what I'm
going to start with yet, but I'll figure it out tomorrow.

### **Day 12 - 20: October 12th - 20th, 2023**

Well, if there's anything that I _really_ learned so far it has nothing to do
with codding. Turns out that it's pretty hard to keep up with a daily schedule
when you have a full-time job, a side project, you contribute to open-source,
and have a family trip spanning over a week. Who would've thought?

Anyway, I'm back on track now. I've decided to start with the
[Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/perl5) and for the next couple of days
I'll be working on the exercises there. I'll post my solutions in the code
section of this repo.

Also, there's a slight change when it comes to the schedule. I won't start with
a new language every month. Instead, I'll be spending a month on each language.

That way, I'll have more time to explore each language, and I'll be able to
focus on other things as well. I guess I was a bit too ambitious with the
original plan.

It's hard to do all the stuff _and_ learn and write about a new language every
day on top of that. I'm not a robot, you know. 🤖

### **Day 21: November 1st, 2023**

I am failing miserably at this. There has been so much happening in the last
couple of weeks that I didn't have time to do anything. I'm going to try to
catch up in the next couple of days.

But out of curiosity, I've decided to check what next language I might be
learning. And it looks like it's going to be the good, old *C*!
