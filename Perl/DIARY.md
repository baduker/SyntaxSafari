### **Day 1: October 1st, 2023**

So, I've rolled the (pseudo-random) dice, and it looks like we've got Perl for
my first stop on the safari.

I've never really used Perl beyond a few one-liners here and there, so I'm
excited to see what it's all about.

Also, I've heard that Perl is a bit of a "write-only" language, so I'm curious
to see if that's true.
And some even say that Perl's dead. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I guess
we'll find out soon enough.

In the first couple of days, I'm going to focus on getting a feel for the language
and its ecosystem. I'll be reading the official docs, checking out some tutorials,
researching some best practices, and maybe even reading a book or two.


### **Day 2: October 2nd, 2023**

Today, I mostly did some reading and research. I started with the Wikipedia page,
bookmarked a couple of resources for later, and picked up a copy of the famous
["Lama Book"](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Perl-Making-Things-Possible/dp/1491954329)

I also added the first couple of entries in the [GLOSSARY](../GLOSSARY.md).
Turned out, I had to move it to the root directory, because it's going to be
shared by all the languages, and it takes some amount of dexterity to keep
typing _Miscellaneous_ correctly.

What I didn't do today was actually compile a selection of resources.
